# Maytes .NET SDK

Official .NET client for the [Maytes API](https://developers.maytes.co) — create,
capture and cancel checkouts, and verify inbound webhook signatures.

> **Generated package.** This repository is a build artefact, published from the
> Maytes API service definition. Pull requests here are not accepted — file
> issues instead, and fixes land upstream in the source model.

## Install

```bash
dotnet add package Maytes.ApiClient.Net
```

## Usage

The client mints an OAuth2 `client_credentials` token on first use, caches it,
and — on a `401` — refreshes and retries the request once. There is no
client-side expiry maths to get wrong, and no proactive refresh to schedule.

```csharp
using MaytesApiClient.Auth;
using MaytesApiClient.Webhooks;

var api = ClientFactory.Create(endpoint, clientId, clientSecret);
var checkout = await api.CreateCheckoutAsync(request);

var evt = WebhookVerifier.Verify(rawBody, signatureHeader, signingSecret);
```

### Verifying webhooks

Verify **before** parsing the body, and pass the raw request bytes — not a
re-encoded object. Re-serialising changes the bytes and the signature will not
match. The event id is stable across retries, so deduplicate on it.
